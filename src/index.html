                <h4>Introduction</h4>

                <p>In this study, we analyze 33,678 journalism and media-related grants totaling $1.8 billion distributed between 2010 and 2015 by 6,568 foundations. We not only analyzed patterns in foundation funding specific to the production and dissemination of nonprofit journalism and media, but also affiliated activities such as the operation of public media organizations; journalistic/media partnerships and supporting services; journalism research, technology development, legal support, and philanthropic coordination; university-based journalism education; journalistic associations, professional development and specialized training programs; and public education about journalism by way of museums.</p>
                
                <p>Combining largescale data analysis with dozens of interviews, our paper identifies successes, disparities, and needs more comprehensively than has been done previously, helping, we hope, to facilitate discussion and planning in the post-2016 election era about the enormous challenges our news media system and democracy faces.</p> 

                <p>Below, some of our key findings.</p>

                <h2 class="subhead">“Nearly half of foundation funding goes to public radio and television stations”</h2>

                <p>Between 2010 and 2015, approximately half of all foundation funding was devoted to supporting decades-old, legacy non-profit media. $795 million, or 44% of the $1.8 billion we analyzed, supported the operation of public radio and television stations along with their affiliated programs and news reporting initiatives.</p>

                <p>Grant making in this category also funded national news and programming providers such as National Public Radio, American Public Media, Public Radio International, and the PBS NewsHour. In comparison, $330 million or 18% of all foundation funding supported mostly newer, digital-based forms of nonprofit media which include national nonprofit news organizations like ProPublica, the Center for Public Integrity and the Center for Investigative Reporting; local non-profit news organizations like <b>TKTK and TKTK</b>; and university-based journalism initiatives like the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University’s School of Communication and the News21 projects at Arizona State University. </p>

    			<h2>“Public media organizations in 10 states account for 83% of total foundation funding”</h2>

    			<p>Foundation funding for public media tends to be highly concentrated among a few dozen grant recipients clustered in a few different geographic regions. Eighteen “super” stations along with the content-producers/distributors National Public Radio, Sesame Workshop, Public Radio International, StoryCorps, the Public Radio Exchange, and Free Speech TV received a combined $562 million, or 70% of all foundation funding given to public media between 2010 and 2015.</p> 

                <p>Seventeen of the grantees are based in the San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis, Boston, New York City, or DC/Virginia regions. Public media organizations based in 10 states accounted for $657 million in grants, or 83% of total foundation funding.</p>

    			<h2>“8 out of 10 foundation dollars flowed to just 25 news nonprofits”</h2>

    			<p>Between 2010 and 2015, 8 out of 10 foundation dollars flowed to just 25 news nonprofits with 4 investigative journalism units topping the list. Many of these nonprofits are focused on the environment and several have a clear ideological perspective. Overall, national news nonprofits are highly dependent on about two dozen institutional funders which provided nearly 70% of the grants distributed over the 6-year period analyzed. Not only has similar concentration of investments occurred across local/state news nonprofits and university-based journalism initiatives, but these outlets remain dependent on an even smaller number of major funders, most notably the Knight Foundation.</p>

                <p>As layoffs at newspapers continue at a rapid rate across the country, extreme geographic disparities in foundation funding also exist, with the great majority of regions lacking a local/state news nonprofit or university-based journalism initiative. This absence is made worse by the concentration to a lesser degree of public media grants to stations in a few cities and states.</p>
